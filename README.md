# Week11UpdateDeleteMySQL

In this portion of the project I:
Modify the project details using the UPDATE statement.
Delete a project and all child rows using the DELETE statement.
Observe that using ON DELETE CASCADE automatically deletes child rows with a foreign key relationship.
Use the return value from PreparedStatement.executeUpdate() to determine if a row was updated or deleted.
